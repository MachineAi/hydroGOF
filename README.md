# hydroGOF
hydroGOF is an R package that provides S3 functions implementing both statistical and graphical goodness-of-fit measures between observed and simulated values, mainly oriented to be used during the calibration, validation, and application of hydrological models.

Missing values in observed and/or simulated values can removed before the computations.

Bugs / comments / questions / collaboration of any kind are very welcomed.
